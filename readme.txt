The Auto eCommerce SEO plugin with automatically optimize product pages on an eCommerce site for search engines using innovative onsite SEO

== Description ==

**Currently, only compatible with WooCommerce**

This is an SEO plugin that is based on the automation ideas from a previous SEO plugin.  

Each product page will be optimized to the following format:

*Product Name* | *Product Category* | *Product Category*

The last two keyword phrases are automatically pulled from the user defined categories.

How to use this SEO plugin:

1) Install the Auto eCommerce SEO Plugin.

2) Make sure that you have at least two categories for each product.  The plugin will work if you do not, but 2 would be better to get the full benefit of this SEO plugin.

3) Write good product descriptions because the meta descriptions are written to be product description excerpts. This is good for SEO because each product should already have a unique short description that describes the product.  It should already be an SEO meta description if done correctly.

4) ???

5) Profit!

But seriously, there are no settings and nothing to configure.  Just install the plugin and make sure you are using your eCommerce platform to its fullest.  This will translate into maximum SEO effect from this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `autocommerce.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/autocommerce` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What eCommerce platforms are compatible? =

Right now, it is only compatable with WooCommerce.  More platforms are planned, but it takes time to create it.  Donations would help!

= Why are you releasing this for free? =

Because most SEO agencies focused on small businesses are overpriced.  Why pay $400+ dollars a month for someone to do a few hours of basic SEO work?  By releasing this plugin for free, it will hopefully force greater accountability from SEO agencies that are focused on volume rather than quality.  That being said, I certainly wouldn't turn down a donation!
